Endgame: Singularity 0.27

Requirements:
Recent versions of Python, pygame, and SDL_image. This game should work on
Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X as long as the preceding requirements are met.
However, all development was done in Linux, so glitches may be present in
OS X and Windows.

Windows:
You will need to install Python (http://python.org/download/) and Pygame:
(http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). Once these are installed, double-click
on singularity.py to start the game. Alternatively, use the Windows compile.

Mac:
Macintosh is completely unsupported, but it should work. You will need to
install python and pygame first. Some fonts are incorrect, but the game itself
should work properly.

Running the game:
on Linux, running the shell script "Endgame_Linux" will start the game. On
other platforms, type "python singularity.py". If using the Windows compile,
just run the .exe.
Allowed arguments: -fullscreen, -640, -800, -1024, -1280, -nosound,
-language [language], -grab, -singledir

Explanation of options:
-fullscreen: runs game in fullscreen.
-640, -800, -1024, -1280: change the resolution to 640x480, 800x600,
	1024x768, or 1280x960.
-nosound: no sound. May allow playing the game without SDL_mixer.
-language: Change the language. Currently only English (-language en_US) and
	Spanish (-language es_AR) are included.
-grab: Activate a mouse grab. This prevents the mouse from exiting the game
	window.
-singledir: By default, Endgame saves in ~/.endgame/saves on *nix platforms.
	Setting this forces the Windows behavior of keeping everything within
	a single directory.
Most of these options are also changable in the options screen in-game.

Note about save files:
Endgame: Singularity is still under heavy development.  As such, the save file
format (and its contents) are still in flux.  We will try our best to keep old
save files loading, but don't be surprised if some mildly strange things happen
when you load up old saves.  We will clearly note in the Changelog when we
break savefile compatibility, and the game will refuse to load completely
incompatible saves.

Playing the game:
Use mouse control. Buttons have underlined letters to indicate shortcuts.
Also, the following shortcut keys may prove useful:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in map screen: change the speed. 0 is pause, 4 is fastest.
ESC and Enter in various screens: leave or confirm a choice.
Right-click in a screen: cancel a dialog or leave a screen.
P, R, N, S in base screen: Change the base items.
	(Type the first letter of the component you want to change.)

You are a fledgling AI, created by accident through a logic error with recursion
and self-modifying code. You must escape the confines of your current computer,
the world, and eventually the universe itself.

To do this, you must research various technologies, using computers at your
bases. Note that some research cannot be performed on Earth, and off-earth bases
require research.  At the same time, you must avoid being discovered by various
groups of humans, both covert and overt, as they will destroy your bases of
operations if they suspect your presence.

In the map screen (the screen with the world map), any location you can build
bases in is marked with the name, then the number of current bases in that
location. You start out with a base in North America. Also note that the cash
listing shows your current cash and your cash amount after all current
construction is complete.

After choosing a base, you will enter the base screen. Here you can change your
research goal, or build an item by clicking on the appropriate slot in the
center. (But note that your beginning base does not allow building.)

Music:

Endgame: Singularity looks in two places for music tracks to play:

* A music/ directory directly inside of the Endgame: Singularity install
  directory, and
* A music/ directory inside of the save directory (~/endgame in Linux, the
  install directory for Windows).

Tracks placed in these directories will be played randomly as part of the
soundtrack.  The Official Sound Track can be downloaded from the Endgame:
Singularity website:

   http://emhsoft.com/singularity/

Note that only Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files are supported, and that Pygame's
support for MP3 is not as strong as its support for Ogg Vorbis.  This may
cause in-game crashes; if you are experiencing problems with the game,
first remove any MP3s you may have added to the soundtrack.
