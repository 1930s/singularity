Endgame: Singularity 0.20

Requirements:
Recent version of Python, pygame, and SDL_image. This game should work on Linux,
Windows, and Mac OSX as long as the preceding requirements are met. However,
all development was done in Linux, so glitches may be present in OSX and
Windows.

Running the game:
on Linux, running the shell script "Endgame_Linux" will start the game. On
other platforms, type "python singularity.py".
Allowed arguments: -fullscreen, -640, -800, -1024, -1280, -nosound


Playing the game:
Use mouse control. Buttons have underlined letters to indicate shortcuts.

You are a fledgling AI, created by accident through a logic error with recursion
and self-modifying code. You must escape the confines of your current computer,
the world, and eventually the universe itself.

To do this, you must research various technologies, using computers at your bases.
Note that some research cannot be performed on Earth, and off-earth bases require
research.  At the same time, you must avoid being discovered by various groups of
humans, both covert and overt, as they will destroy your bases of operations if
they suspect your presence.

In the map screen (the screen with the world map), any location you can build bases
in is marked with the name, then the number of current bases in that location.
You start out with two bases in North America.

After choosing a base, you enter the base screen. Here you can change your research
goal, or build an item by clicking on the base map in the center. (But note that
your beginning base does not allow building.)
