Todo for 0.27:
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Add more items.
    - Get more items translatable.
    - Make construction that requires CPU a research option when needed. Complete implementation.
    - Convert CPU usage into pools instead of per-base settings.
    - Fix reactors and security to actually use the values given in items.txt.
