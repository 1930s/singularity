Todo for 0.24:
    - Fix listboxes to use PgUp/Home/etc.
    - Make suspicion reduction quadratic, based on type:
      Public > Media > Science > Covert
      (suggested by Ticho)
    - Fix the constant "CPU complete" dialogs when low on money.
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Give items per-area restrictions, then add more items.
    - Better cash display. Internal tracking remains unchanged, but all displays
      are of the form 123.450M or 321.123B. (Million, Billion, Trillion) Reality
      bubbles are the most expensive object at 8 trillion, so there is no need
      for quadrillion for now. All displays use <=3 digits before and after the
      decimal, so we won't have any more problems with costs overflowing out of
      their space.
    - Add 'ABOUT' to main menu, with info, version, etc.
