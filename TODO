TODO:
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Add more items.
    - Get more items translatable.
    - Make construction that requires CPU a research option when needed. Complete implementation.
    - Convert CPU usage into pools instead of per-base settings.
    - Make it so that double-click is equivalent to 'OK' in dialogs. (rubikcube)
    - Make translations easier to do.  (Phil has good ideas on how to do this.)
    - Sort bases by size. (emh for suggestion)
    - Make 'Impossible' more impossible--perhaps get rid of the quadratic
      reductions?
    - Make discoveries in a particular location up the chance for a while of
      discoveries of other bases in said location.  (Durandal7 for suggestion.)
    - In general, differentiate locations (especially the starting continents)
      more.
    - Make it so that it's not always day 22 when you can get discovered; make
      it the less of [some amount of money collected | some amount of time
      passed | some number of bases built | some amount of CPU spent
      researching].
    - Arbitrary resolution, including non 4:3 scales.
    - Consistent use of stderr and print.
    - Make effects of construction class techs more obvious.
    - Add intro.
    - When you start the game, you shouldn't be able to tell what the discovery
      chances are (either overall or per-location).  Techs you research should
      enable these displays.
