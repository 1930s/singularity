Todo for 0.24:
    - Make suspicion reduction quadratic, based on type:
      Public > Media > Science > Covert
      (suggested by Ticho)
    - Fix the constant "CPU complete" dialogs when low on money.
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Give items per-area restrictions, then add more items.
    - Add 'ABOUT' to main menu, with info, version, etc.
