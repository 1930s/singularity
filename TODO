TODO:
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Add more items.
    - Covert data/strings_ll_CC.dat entries to new messages_ll_CC.po style
    - Design a way to do the above with events,locations,techs, etc
    - Make it so that double-click is equivalent to 'OK' in dialogs. (rubikcube)
    - Consistent use of stderr and print, preferably using available Logger
    - Reload all dialogs and buttons when language changes
    - Fix hotkeys when language changes
    - Make buttons extract hotkey from their own labels using "&" markers (ongoing - MestreLion)
    - Revamp Options screen (several #TODO: remarks in code/screens/options.py)
    - Prevent language-dependent data from BaseType and Buyable, either loading game or
      switching language, to "contaminate" g.location.bases[*].type/.cpus. Approaches:
      - replace all occurrences to use g.base_type[baselocation.bases[i].type.id]
      - force refresh of bases.type and bases.cpus in g.load_location_defs()
      - prevent leaking in Location.add_base
      - fix cPickle to load the updated references
