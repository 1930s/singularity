Todo for 0.24:
   - Fix listboxes to use PgUp/Home/etc.
   - Make suspicion reduction quadratic, based on type:
      Public > Media > Science > Covert
     (suggested by Ticho)
   - Fix the constant "CPU complete" dialogs when low on money.
   - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
     for both "scores" and general statistics.
